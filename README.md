### [Official Doc](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/)

Cloud Build is a service that executes your builds on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. Cloud Build can import source code from `Google Cloud Storage, Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket,` execute a build to your specifications, and produce artifacts such as Docker containers or Java archives.
Cloud Build executes your `build as a series of build steps,` where each build step is run in a Docker container. A build step can do anything that can be done from a container irrespective of the environment. To perform your tasks, you can either use the supported build steps provided by Cloud Build or write your own build steps.
